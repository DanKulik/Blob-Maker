# Blob-Maker
Create Blob Shapes in Python

This code creates blobs 2d/3d using various numpy distribution functions and smoothes through the data by applying a Gaussian filter. The size and shape of each blob may be altered with kwargs allowing for truly unique and random outputs. This python script has been adapted to run as an import as long as it is in the working folder of the current working script. Return values include x and y arrays, and plotting the blob is also kwarg optional. 

This script was intended for scientific reasons, however it may have applications in a variety of fields. 
Please feel free to use the script for your projects and any feedback would be much appreciated.
Thank you for your patronage.
